        <!-- Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious heart attack inducing meal made from a cold stick of butter being covered in batter and deep
            fried. This delicacy originates from Texas and is the creation from the legendary Abel Gonzales Jr, who 
            introduced this item at the Texas state fair in 2009.

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk brown sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. 
                Dip each piece of butter into cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat completely. 
                Place butter pieces in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. 
                Freeze until hard, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup flour, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. 
                Beat buttermilk, eggs, and white sugar together in another bowl; add flour mixture to 
                buttermilk mixture and beat until smooth. Gradually stir remaining flour into buttermilk 
                mixture until desired batter consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Poke a toothpick into the center of each frozen piece of butter. 
                Dip butter into batter to coat completely.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, carefully drop coated butter pieces into hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, 
                until golden brown and puffed, about 2 minutes. Transfer fried butter to a paper-towel lined plate 
                and dust with confectioners' sugar.</li>
        </ol>
