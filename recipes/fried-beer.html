        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried beer is a delicous invention of Mark Zable, who introduced the dish at the 2010 Texas State fair.
            This item is potentially the most creative on this list, as the process of making it required figuring
            out how to create a batter that could hold the beer in place.
