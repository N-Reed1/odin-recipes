        <!-- Description of the dish -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried beer is a delicous invention of Mark Zable, who introduced the dish at the 2010 Texas State fair.
            This item is potentially the most creative on this list, as the process of making it required figuring
            out how to create a batter that could hold the beer in place. 
        </p>

        <!-- Ingrediants -->
        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp (9.45 g) of yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (12.5 g) of sugar</li>
            <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420 g) of flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (75 g) of butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5 g) of salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 can of beer</li>
            <li>2 cups (470 ml) of vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place 1 tbsp (9.45 g) of yeast, 1 cup (240 ml) of lukewarm water, and 1 tbsp (12.5 g) of sugar into the bowl. 
                Use a whisk to mix the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup (120 g) of flour into the bowl with the yeast, lukewarm water, and sugar. 
                Use a whisk to combine the flour with the other ingredients. 
                Leave the mixture resting until small bubbles appear.</li>
            <li>Transfer 1/3 cup (75 g) of butter, 1 tsp (5 g) of salt, and the remaining 2 1/2 cups (300 g) of flour into the bowl 
                with the yeast mixture. Use your hands to knead the ingredients together. Stop kneading once the butter is evenly 
                distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
            <li>Take the dough from the bowl and place it onto a clean work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out 
                until it looks like a thin sheet and is approximately 1/5 in (0.51 cm) thick.</li>
            <li>Crack 3 eggs into a bowl. Use a whisk to beat the eggs until the whites and the yolks have combined. 
                Coat the dough thoroughly using a pastry brush to spread the egg mixture out.</li>
            <li>Run the blade of the ravioli cutter along the dough. 
                Divide the dough using the ravioli cutter into small rectangles.</li>
            <li>Pair up each of the ravioli pieces. Gently press along the 2 short edges and 1 long edge to create a pocket. 
                Leave the last long edge open as this will be where you pour the beer in.</li>
            <li>Prop each ravioli pocket up against a cup or a glass so that each one rests upright and the pocket stays open. 
                Open the can of beer and pour a small amount into each pocket. Make sure that you don't fill the pockets all of 
                the way, as otherwise, the ravioli will not be able to hold the liquid.</li>
            <li>Gently seal the open edge of each ravioli pocket. Try not to press too firmly as otherwise, 
                the dough could break and the beer would spill out.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of vegetable oil into a deep pan and adjust the stovetop temperature to a high setting. 
                Use a candy thermometer to monitor the oil as it heats.</li>
            <li>Once the oil has reached the desired temperature, use a slotted spoon to carefully place 1 pocket into the pan. 
                Set the timer for 20 seconds and use a slotted spoon to remove the pocket once the time is up.</li>
            <li>As each ravioli pocket is removed from the pan, transfer it directly onto a plate that is covered with paper towels.
                This will help to absorb the extra oil. Place the ravioli pockets next to each other rather than stacking them.</li>
            <li>When the deep-fried beer pockets have been removed from the pan, they will be hot and may burn you if you touch 
                them. Leave them to cool on the paper towel for a few minutes before enjoying your 
                first taste of deep-fried beer!</li>
        </ol>
